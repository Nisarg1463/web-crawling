efficiency i appreciated the two speed settings enabling me to tackle a wide range of tasks from drilling to screwdriving without needing to switch tools battery life the 20v lithium ion battery is impressive it held up well during prolonged usage and the fact that it s compatible with other tools in the hammer pulse lineup is a huge advantage the included charger replenished the battery
